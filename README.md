Hey everybody, welcome to Algo Expert. In this video, we're going to answer the following behavioral interview question.

How would you go about distributing work for a project across a team of software engineers?

If you've led a project in the past, describe what you did.

So, I think that the first thing I would do, which is the first thing that you probably should do if you're trying to distribute work across a team of engineers, is to scope out the work.

It's very important for you to understand what it is exactly that you're building and to have a clear picture of the various logical chunks that the project or the work can be divided into that engineers on your team can then take ownership of.

So, you want to divide the work into these sensible chunks, and here it's kind of half art, half science, because you don't want to be too vague, like you don't want to just say, "Oh, the chunk of work is that we have to build an API that's kind of too vague."

But on the other hand, you probably don't want to go too deep or too granular.

For instance, if we're talking about front-end engineering and you're building, you know, a brand new product or feature that's got five different pages, and one of those pages is a form, you probably don't want to divide it into each individual input field.

That might be something for the engineer who's going to be taking charge of that page. That might be for them to do in their own design doc of that page or what have you.

So, point is, you want to scope out the work without being too deep or too, you know, far removed.

And here, my guideline typically would be, you know, if we're talking about back-end, maybe scope out the work with, you know, the various API endpoints that you're going to be building or the various, you know, logical pieces of functionality of a feature that you're going to be supporting.

For the front-end, maybe the different pages that you're going to be building out.

Once you've done that, you have to be able to balance a few things at the same time.

So, first of all, you have to make sure that the work gets done, right?

And so, work that is highly critical and that is very difficult has to be prioritized.

And oftentimes, it has to be assigned to the most capable person.

If you've got maybe a senior engineer on the team who would be most qualified to complete this very complicated part of the project and who would be the least risky person to assign this part of the project to, then that might just have to happen.

Now, this actually can go against one of the other things that you need to balance, which is people's happiness, right?

If you're on a team, you want to make sure that your engineers are happy.

And sometimes, you know, some people have preferences.

Maybe another engineer is going to say, "Hey, I would have really wanted to... I would have really liked to work on this part of the feature."

But you have to, you know, use your judgment to see if that would make sense.

And sometimes, those priorities, like the critical work, and assigning it to someone who's able to complete it, is going to, you know, take precedence over someone's preference of what they want to work on.

And then the last thing that you want to balance is your engineers' career trajectories, because... and this might be, I guess, more relevant for managers, but even as a peer, if you're, let's say, you know, the team lead of a project, or the project lead of a project, you want to look out for your peers, and you want to make sure that they're best equipped for their career, to grow in their career, and same for yourself, to be honest.

And so, if you've got one engineer on your team who really needs to focus on proving their technical... their ability to build out technically complex features, then ideally, you can assign to them technically complex features.

If you've got someone who needs to work a little bit more with other teams and other stakeholders, then maybe it might make sense to put them on a part of the project that is going to involve, you know, meetings with backend engineers, or with product managers, or UX designers.

Point is, you have to balance all of these things, right?

The criticality, if that's a word, of parts of the project to ensure that stuff gets done, people's personal preferences, just to make sure that people are happy, and also people's career trajectories, and making sure that you're setting them up for success.

Now, one thing that is sometimes overlooked, that's also important to keep in mind, is just logistical issues.

So sometimes, you know, you'll have some people who have to travel at one point during the quarter, or some people who, for whatever reason, you know, have a commitment that they can't get out of, and that's going to prevent them from attending certain meetings, or they won't be able to attend meetings with other engineers who are in a different time zone at a specific time.

When you've got these logistical issues, you have to also keep them in mind in the way that you distribute the work.

If someone is not going to be able to attend meetings with engineers who are in a completely different time zone late in the day, then maybe, you know, somebody else should do the work that is going to require attending those meetings.

And so, everything that I'm describing here stems from, well, stems from a lot of different experiences, but I'm specifically thinking about one, which was the last project that I worked on when I was a software engineer at Google.

I was leading the project, I was kind of the tech lead of the project, and this was a very large project.

We had engineers in a different time zone in South Korea, so 14 hours ahead.

Lots of work, new engineers, existing engineers, people of different levels.

And so, I basically applied everything that I'm describing here.

You know, I scoped out the work, not too granular, but not too high level, assigned it in a way that made most sense.

So, parts of the project that didn't require too much context in the code base were given to some of these new engineers that were just joining the team.

Parts of the project that were very critical and that needed a lot of context were given to existing engineers who had already been on the team.

Even if they were not necessarily going to benefit from having those technically complex projects under their belt, maybe they would have been better given to a more junior engineer who would have really been able to make use of that, had to make some trade-offs there.

And then finally, the time zone thing.

I made sure to assign work in a way that made sense and respected people's preferences with when they like to work, whether or not they're going to be able to go to meetings with engineers in a different time zone, and so on and so forth.

Why do you wanna work at insert company name?

So quick pause before I answer this question.

I'm gonna answer this question as if I were currently working at Google and applying to Facebook.

So the question would be, why do I wanna work at GoTo?

So I wanna work at GoTo for three main reasons.

The first one is from a purely technical point of view.

I feel that GoTo is a big tech company, works in a lot of technologies that really excite me, technologies that I've worked a lot on in personal projects. also I realy like interacting with people, especial foreigners, having a tendency to work in multinational company. yes Goto is a good choice.


So basically, all of or a lot of GoTo's technology and products really excites me and interests me.

Now, putting aside the technical stuff for a bit, I'm also really interested or excited about GoTo's culture. like 

Three Zeros Commitments
1. Zero Emissions:Focusing on decarbonization efforts for direct and indirect emissions
2.Zero Waste:Accelerate the reusing, repurposing, recycling and processing of waste
3.Zero Barriers:Focuses on reducing barriers to socioecomonic growth for driver and merchant partners in our ecosystem


I've heard about the, I don't know if it's an unofficial or official motto, move fast and break things.

I don't know if that's kind of an old motto or a recent one or still applicable today, but the point is, I have heard that Facebook has a very unique culture of moving fast, and that's something that really excites me.

Having worked at Google for two years now, even though I've had incredible opportunities, I've worked with incredible people in a very engineering excellence driven company, one thing that has been frustrating at times has been the slowness of some of the engineering projects I've worked on, and from a few peers I've known who worked at Google and now have gone to Facebook, apparently this difference in culture and the velocity with which you can ship out code and ship out projects, launch projects and features is pretty dramatic, the difference between the two companies.

And so I'm really excited about that at Facebook.

Finally, the third thing that is particularly attracting me to Facebook is Facebook's bootcamp experience.

So most of the other companies I've looked at, when you apply to them, you have to apply to a specific team, or for example at Google, you don't apply to a specific team in most cases, but once you pass the interviews, you go through their team matching process and you have to commit to a team before your first day on the job.

At Facebook, I've read a lot about the bootcamp experience and my recruiter told me about it, I'm really excited about being able to try out, actually work on multiple different teams before having to commit to one.

That's something that is incredibly unique, I haven't heard about another company doing that, it's something that really is appealing to me.

And on that note, at the end of the interview, if we have time, I'd love to ask you what your experience was with bootcamp, what you liked about it and how it worked.



==================

So what exactly is GoTo, and how did it get so big?

GoTo is the largest digital ecosystem in Indonesia, with a mission to 'empower progress' by offering technology infrastructure and solutions that help everyone to access and thrive in the digital economy. The GoTo ecosystem provides a wide range of services including mobility, food delivery, groceries and logistics, as well as payments, financial services, and technology solutions for merchants. The ecosystem also provides e-commerce services through Tokopedia and banking services through its partnership with Bank Jago.


GoTo Group is an Indonesian tech company formed in a blockbuster merger between two of the country’s largest start-ups: Gojek and Tokopedia.
The main product of the merger, a powerful super app you can use to book a ride,
buy something or make a payment, is today used by tens of millions.

From day one, we offered multiple different services, like a ride-hailing service or a delivery service.

There’s a saying that if you want to go fast, you go alone; if you want to go far, you go together. So GoTo, basically, is go far, go together.

In May 2021, Two of Indonesia’s largest tech  start-ups have announced one of the biggest mergers ever in the world. These two are famously known as Gojek, a ride-hailing and payment services firm, Tokopedia, an e-commerce firm. The two giants made up what is now known as the GoTo Group and it is one of Southeast Asia’s  most valuable start-ups ever. At the time of the  merger, the company got a public big market valuation.  

what GoTo really is. As mentioned earlier, it is a merger of Indonesia’s biggest tech giants which are Gojek and Tokopedia. 

Gojek, the first company that is a multi-service platform with products and services such as ride-hailing, food delivery, and entertainment services, video streaming platform, and financial services. Gojek is one of the top companies that is changing the world. It is a company that operates in most of the countries in Southeast Asia and is offering a wide array of services. 

Tokopedia is an e-commerce platform, fintech, logistics,  
The Tokopedia Platform and fulfillment business. Like Gojek, Tokopedia  is also a billion-dollar business.

These two together combined makeup one of  the biggest internet companies of Southeast Asia

Hey everybody, welcome to Algo Expert. In this video we're going to answer the following question.

Describe a time when you strongly disagreed with a co-worker about an engineering decision.

How did you go about making the final decision? What did you do after the decision was made?

So there have been many times when I've disagreed with co-workers. When I was at Google, when I was at Facebook, and especially now that I'm running Algo Expert full-time.

And oftentimes these have been pretty big disagreements. Especially now on Algo Expert because the engineering disagreements that we usually have have big product ramifications.

So they end up being product disagreements as well and even, you know, business disagreements, if that makes sense. Now I do think that it's less meaningful for me to focus on a particular disagreement that I've had as much as it is to focus on the general system or process that I follow when we have disagreements. So that's what I'm going to focus on here. And the process that I follow really has three steps. And they're actually kind of inspired by some of the leadership principles at Amazon, if you're familiar with those. So the first step, which is one of the Amazon leadership principles, I think, is to dig deep. To really try to understand every person who's part of the disagreement, all of their ideas, their arguments, and their stances.

You have to understand why someone you're disagreeing with, why they came to the conclusion that they came to. And they have to understand why and how you came to your conclusion. As an example, let's say someone wants to change a piece of code and you don't want to change that piece of code, you disagree with their change. You have to understand why are they changing that piece of code. Is it because they think it'll be better? Okay, probably. But why is it going to be better? Is it because it'll be stylistically better? Okay. Is it because it'll be more performant? Okay, that's another option. Is it because it'll be something that they just prefer? You know, they have a personal preference. Is it because it'll be more consistent with the code base?

You see, there are a lot of different reasons for which someone might think a piece of code is going to be better. You have to understand that. And then once you get to that answer, you continue asking why. You continue dissecting the idea. Well, why do we want to be consistent with the rest of our code base? Why do we want to be more performant? Do we want to be more performant? And again, here in this trivial example, this might seem kind of silly, but in a larger, you know, feature or in a larger decision or disagreement, this might make a lot of sense because someone might have a completely different idea precisely because they think that performance doesn't matter for this particular feature. So super important, dissect people's ideas, try to find loopholes in their arguments just because that'll lead you to a better decision.

And that might sway other people one way or another. Now, one very important aspect of this process here is that you do not want to attack people. You want to attack ideas. Attacking people is toxic, it's unhealthy, it's not professional. You don't want to do that. You want to attack ideas. And what that means is that you have to make sure you're not attacking people, but you also have to make sure that when people are attacking your ideas, you don't take that personally. So these are kind of important, important things that every individual in the disagreement has to kind of internalize for this to actually work. But so that was the first step. You dig deep, really try to understand why people are coming to the conclusions that they're coming to. The second step is to take a step back and to kind of see things from a higher level, from a higher perspective, because oftentimes the environment that you're in, the ecosystem that you're in, maybe the company's current stance or point in time, that might influence the engineering decision.

Now, there have been many times on Algo Expert where we had a disagreement on an engineering decision. If you purely looked at the arguments from both sides without looking at the bigger picture, one person was clearly right. Like, okay, this is, it's better not to do this feature because from an engineering point of view, it'll take far too much time. It'll worsen other parts of the code base. We'll have to use another third party service that we really shouldn't be using, blah, blah, blah. And we agree that that's the better decision. But if you take a step back and you realize that our business's livelihood depends on doing this feature, then well, suddenly, you know, there's an art, there's an additional argument for doing that feature. So got to take a step back sometimes and realize that your organization or your team might have priorities that trump some of the arguments at the purely engineering level.

And then finally, the third part of this process or system that I've got in place, and I think this one is again based on a Amazon leadership principle, or not necessarily based, but I think they have a leadership principle that's similar, is that you want to strongly disagree. You want to do everything that I said, dissect each other's ideas, all of that. But once it comes to making a decision, you have to commit to the decision that gets made. Once the decision is made, rather, you have to commit to that decision. You can't hold grudges, especially if the decision doesn't go your way. If it goes your way, then obviously you'll be happy. But if it doesn't go your way, you have to be able to accept that. You have to commit to the decision that was made, and you have to move forward as if that had been your decision to make sure that the product and the team and everything just goes smoothly.

And of course, I guess here I skipped over one step, which is like, how do you make the decision? Because sometimes someone will change their mind, and that's great. You'll make the decision. Everybody will be happy. But other times, despite all of the arguing and dissecting people's ideas and all that, you still will have a big disagreement. People will still not agree to agree with each other. And in that case, you really have two options. Either you do a majority vote. You vote to see what decisions should be made, and that can work very well. Or you escalate the decision to a decision maker. Typically, that will be someone who's previously appointed, like a manager or your manager's manager, maybe your team lead, tech lead, whatever you want to call it, and they have to make the decision.

If you do escalate to a decision maker, you have to make sure if they weren't part of the disagreement, that they get the full context. You have to present them with all the arguments and everything to make sure that they make a sound decision. But once the decision is made, like I said, commit to the decision. And yeah, this is how I've handled most, if not all, of my disagreements at work, and how I plan to continue handling disagreements at work.

Sure! Here’s the extracted English text from the provided content:

Hey everybody, welcome to Algo Expert. In this video, we're going to answer the following behavioral interview question. How do you think about receiving and giving feedback? Describe a time when you received tough feedback and/or a time when you gave tough feedback. How did you react to it? How did you give it? So I'm a firm believer in giving constructive feedback by way of radical transparency. Now I realize that the term or the expression "radical transparency" is a bit of a buzzword, but I do think that it's a very useful one, a very applicable one here in the context of giving feedback. You want to be very prompt and direct in giving your feedback or in receiving feedback. There is no better way to improve as a human being and of course as a software engineer, if we're talking about this in the context of software engineering, than by receiving quality constructive feedback that is direct, that doesn't put things vaguely or fluff things up, and that is also prompt, meaning it doesn't come two months, three months after the fact. It comes one week or one day after something has occurred that deserves feedback. Now one additional thing that I want to add here is that I think it's very important when giving feedback to and receiving feedback to give or ask for actionable steps to improve. In other words, it doesn't really help a person who's receiving feedback if you just tell them that they're doing something wrong or doing something poorly without telling them how they can improve, what they can do, what steps they can take to improve. So that's very important, but really I think that this concept of radical transparency is super useful and it's very different from being overly harsh and just mean to people, which is obviously not good and not useful, and very different from being overly nice and hiding things from people just to protect them, so to speak. That doesn't help them. But so as far as examples of when I've received and given feedback, one particular example that comes to mind for when I received feedback was near the start of my career as a software engineer at Google. I think I had been at Google for about two or three months, and one of my peers following a pull request that I had sent out with code basically came up to me and told me, "Hey, Clement, you know, this might sound harsh, but I just want to tell you I think you're writing certain front-end components the wrong way, or not necessarily the wrong way, but in a suboptimal way." And of course, you know, as with all kinds of constructive feedback, which is effectively negative feedback but meant to improve you, I reacted a little bit, you know, had a bit of a tense reaction. You always feel you're kind of like, "Ugh, am I being attacked?" or whatever, but you quickly realize like this is how you improve. And so I had a good conversation with him and, you know, we talked about how I could actually, you know, why were these front-end components that I was writing suboptimal, what was bad, or, you know, what could be improved about them. And, you know, I learned a lot from that. We talked about, you know, stateless components versus stateful components, all that stuff, all that good front-end engineering stuff. And I really improved following that conversation. I noticed it, you know, when I would write future pull requests and future components that the things that this person had told me were true, and I was now applying them, and it was just a great experience. Now, for the time that I gave feedback to someone, this was one of the first interns that I hosted while at Google. And I remember this was a really bright person, really excited, really talented, very good software engineer. One thing that he would do that wasn't particularly good, that could have been improved, was that, especially in our one-on-one meetings, and even in group meetings, he would often, you know, start talking, start asking questions, or start, you know, giving ideas. But he, it kind of felt like he hadn't prepared his thoughts, and he would start rambling on for pretty, like, noticeable periods of time. And so, I told him after I saw him do that, I think, like, three times, so pretty promptly, I told him in one of our one-on-one meetings, "Hey, like, this is something where I think you could improve, that you could improve on." You know, as far as actionable steps, I told him, "Just try to prepare yourself and gather your thoughts a little bit more before you take the microphone, so to speak." And again, as with any time that you give feedback or receive feedback, when it's constructive and it effectively feels like it's negative, you kind of tense up, I could see it in his face, but afterwards, he totally, you know, accepted it, acknowledged it, and at our next one-on-one, he told me that he really appreciated the feedback, he really took it to heart, and what do you know, by the end of the internship, he had completely improved in this regard. And not only had he continued to be a great public speaker, but he was really honing his skills of not, you know, rambling on, not being prepared before speaking. So that was another great example of where direct, radically transparent prompt feedback is very useful.

Hey everybody, welcome to Algo Expert. In this video we're going to answer the following behavioral interview question.

Describe a time when you had to deal with an outage at work. How did you handle the situation? What steps did you take after the issue was resolved?

So, throughout my entire software engineering career, I would say that I've experienced about a handful of real production outages.

Now the one that's most memorable, the one that I want to talk about here, is actually the very first real production outage that I ever experienced.

It happened back in 2017. I had been at Google as a software engineer for a little over six months.

And one afternoon, it was kind of late in the afternoon, I was the last person on my team, or at least the last engineer on my team, at the office.

And I happened to go on the UI, the user interface, of my team's product. I worked on Google Cloud Platform on the front end of a particular Google Cloud Platform product.

And so I go on the website, on the UI, and one of our primary pages was just blank. It wasn't loading, nothing on the screen, just completely blank.

So obviously for a split second, I kind of panicked, "What's going on?" Then I composed myself, and here's how I handled this, what turned out to be a pretty bad production outage.

The first thing that I did is, I wanted to confirm that this was actually a real bug in production and not just something with my computer or my account or something like that.

So I asked a couple people who were around me, these were not my teammates, because like I said, I was the last person from my team at the office,

but a couple of other people who were in proximity to me to go on the link of the page and just to see if they were also experiencing the same thing on their computers, on their accounts.

And yes, they were. So clearly this was a real production issue.

So the second thing that I decided to do was, before alerting anybody else, and I suppose here maybe I should take a step back and say,

at the time, my team didn't have an on-call rotation set up, because if we had had an on-call rotation, the first thing to do here would have been, once I confirmed that this was a real bug,

the first thing to do would have been to flag the bug or the issue to the primary on-call. Just at least have them be aware of what was going on.

We didn't have an on-call rotation at that point in time. We created our on-call rotation a little bit later on.

And this was, by the way, a relatively new Google Cloud Platform product at the time, which is why we didn't have our on-call rotation.

Given that, the first thing that I said I was going to do, or the second thing rather, was I was going to spend five to ten minutes just trying to see if I could debug the issue.

I wanted to see, like, can I fix this without having to alert my teammates who are no longer in the office, without having to alert my manager, who was, I don't know where he was, probably at home.

I spent five to ten minutes trying to debug the issue. Turns out I wasn't able to figure out what the cause of the issue was.

It was a very weird bug, blank page, nothing in the Chrome console. There had been nothing out of the ordinary that day or in the previous days.

So it was really confusing and I just wasn't able to figure it out. So at that point, I did alert the rest of my team after, I would say, about ten minutes.

Because, you know, I think this is one of my philosophies for these types of issues. You never want to be, you don't want to play the hero, right?

If you can, try to figure out the issue within five minutes, but after a certain point, there's no point in hiding this from other people.

The key thing is to fix the issue, not for you to be the hero or for people not to be bothered, if that makes sense.

So after five to ten minutes, alerted my team and fortunately, one of my teammates was actually still in the office, just upstairs getting dinner or something.

So he came down and we started pair programming to try to figure out this bug.

Now, one of the key things also here that we did, which is something that I am a very big proponent of, is even though the situation was pretty stressful,

literally one of the primary pages of our product was down, not working, which meant that the entire product was basically not usable or only half usable.

But so despite the stressful situation, you have to stay calm and you have to also, you know, not point fingers at anybody, not put any blame on anybody.

Because obviously when you're debugging in the moment and everything, it's like, oh, well, this file was poorly written. Why did someone do that?

So I'm not going to go into the bugs here. It's very easy to potentially point fingers and blame people.

I didn't want to do that. And that's just unhealthy in a team in general.

But so we pair programmed, we documented everything that we were doing, keeping our team in the loop.

At that point, my manager was also in the loop. We followed the process that we knew to follow.

Unfortunately, we didn't have some sort of playbook to follow line by line for an outage. And this was a lesson that we learned from this. I'll get into that in a little bit.

But we just documented everything. And after a while, you know, I would say probably after 30 minutes, we decided with my manager, who was chatting with us at this point,

to create an official what's called an OMG at Google, which is basically like an incident report that actually gets flagged kind of at the engineering company level.

And so we did that. We kept the incident report sort of up to date.

And this kind of flags people who are on call and all of Google Cloud Platform and the rest of the company and just followed the procedure there.

Eventually, we figured out what the bug was. It turned out it was something really, really convoluted with Angular, the front end framework.

But that was it. And then we fixed the bug. We had this OMG, this incident report kind of in progress. We eventually closed it.

And, you know, everything was done after that. By the next morning, you know, the new sort of production release or deployment, the bug was fixed.

Now, as for what we did afterwards, we did something that's very common at Google, which I've continued to do even since I've left Google.

And we do it a lot at my current job on Algo Expert, which is to write a postmortem, which is kind of like a document explaining what happened,

the issue, detailing all the steps that were taken to resolve the issue. And most importantly, we answered two questions that I think are crucial to answer after production outage.

Number one, how did we get lucky? And this is a good question to answer because it allows you to determine where there are holes or flaws in your general processes and systems.

For us, we got lucky in the sense that I happened to be at the office late and happened to go on the UI and fall on that page.

Nothing in our systems at that point in time would have flagged that the page was down. And that was clearly an issue.

We had gotten lucky there that we caught the outage quickly and randomly.

And the lesson from that and the thing that we took away from that was that we needed end to end integration tests.

Like I said, we were a fairly new product at the time. We didn't have integration tests, but we obviously, you know, made it a point to create them after this outage.

That was one of our lessons from the postmortem. The second question that I really like to answer in postmortems, which we did, was what could we have done better?

And the thing that we could have done better there was and this was more of a preventative measure was we could have had a written out playbook for how to deal with these kinds of production outages, whom to contact, how to create an incident report, because that was the first time we had all done it.

Or at least me and the engineer pair programming with me. And so, again, another lesson that we took from that it was we need a playbook. And in the couple of weeks following the issue, we actually wrote a, you know, what do you do if you're at work and there's a production outage or what do you do when there's a production outage in general and you have to fix it?

So that's how we handled that incident. That's how I've kind of handled most of the incidents that I've faced since then. And yeah, that's it.
